# `promisestuff`

This library implements promises for Lua. It was intended for use with Minetest,
but you can use it for other stuff by just including "promisestuff.lua". So far
I have tested it with Lua 5.1 and Lua 5.4.

I have documented the [core API](doc/core.md) as well as the [Minetest-specific
API](doc/minetest.md).
